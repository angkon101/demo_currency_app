# demo_currency_app
This is the very first app that I built while learning flutter. This app is built with the insturctions given in the tutorial 
I have just uploaded the lib folder here. To run this app in your machine make sure to copy the lib folder in your machine.
*This is the initial page after entering the currency converter app.*
